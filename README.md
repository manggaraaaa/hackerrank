# Hackerrank
This is for learning practic on HackerRank web : https://www.hackerrank.com .

## Base language programming
* Javascript

## Role of the hackerrank
* Use the same naming convention as previous assignment:

  Using lowercase (such as “Mars Exploration” => “mars-exploration”).

* Every week this file Readme.md will be update.
